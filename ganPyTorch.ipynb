    "### GANs\n",
    "\n",
    "There is more to machine learning than just solving discriminative tasks (d2l.ai, 2021). Generative adversarial networks provide a way to learn deep representations without extensively labeled training data (ieee, 2014). The generative model can be thought of as analogous to a team of counterfeiters, trying to produce fake currency and use it without detection, while the discriminative model is analogous to the police, trying to detect the counterfeit currency (Goodfellow. et al, 2014). They can be characterized by training a pair of net works in competition with each other (IEEE, 2014). One big trend over the last three years has been the application of discriminative deep nets to overcome challenges in problems that we do not generally think of as supervised learning problems (d2l.ai, 2021). \n",
    "\n",
    "GANs are a type of neural network used for unsupervised machine learning (NYU, 2021). They are comprised of two adversarial modules: generator and cost networks (NYU, 2021). \n",
    "\n",
    "These modules compete with each other such that the cost network tries to filter fake examples while the generator tries to trick this filter by creating realistic examples x^\\vect{\\hat{x}}x^ (NYU, 2021). Through this competition, the model learns a generator that creates realistic data (NYU, 2021). They can be used in tasks such as future predictions or for generating images after being trained on a particular dataset (NYU, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "The forger, known in the GAN literature as the generator, ,G creates forgeries, with the aim of making realistic images. The expert, known as the discriminator, ,D receives both forgeries and real (authentic) images, and aims to tell them apart (see Figure 1). Both are trained simultaneously, and in competition with each other (IEEE, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pytorch\n",
    "#### Modify below, since it came from wikipedia\n",
    "Torch is an open-source machine learning library, a scientific computing framework, and a script language based on the Lua programming language.[3] It provides a wide range of algorithms for deep learning, and uses the scripting language LuaJIT, and an underlying C implementation. It was created at IDIAP at EPFL. As of 2018, Torch is no longer in active development.[4] However PyTorch, which is based on the Torch library, is actively developed as of June 2021.[5] \n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that we are using PyTorch for this project. PyTorch is another open source deep learning library. It was initially based on the Torch but is now primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. Facebook also updated and merged the Caffe deep learning framework into PyTorch also. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is an optimized library, based on the tensor representations, for deep learning using GPUs and CPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is very similar to TensorFlow. Pytorch and Tensorflow are by far two of the most popular frameworks for Deep Learning (https://towardsdatascience.com/pytorch-vs-tensorflow-in-2020-fe237862fae1). It has gained significant popularity in recent years due to its; ease of use, rapid prototyping, and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two frameworks had a lot of major differences in terms of design, paradigm, syntax etc till some time back, but they have since evolved a lot, both have picked up good features from each other and are no longer that different (https://towardsdatascience.com/pytorch-vs-tensorflow-in-2020-fe237862fae1).\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of deep learning software has been built using PyTorch; its used internally at Facebook (Meta), Tesla's Autopilot uses PyTorch, Uber's Pyro tool, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is currently as popular as TensorFlow in academic papers being published, and its gaining popularity in Google searches as well:\n",
